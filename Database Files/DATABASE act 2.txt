                                        PART A (CONCEPT CHECK):

1. Data - is a collection where the information and details keep including words, numbers & dates.
   Information - its the organized data soo we can easily understand something.
   DataBase - its inside on a computer where the data is stored and organized.
   Database Management System (DBMS)-a program helps you store find manage data easily.

2. the difference between file-based systems and database systems. 
   file-based system is the file based is that the data`s are separate from each files and 
   the database system is the data`s where stored in one place so anyone can easily access.

3. These are the three advantages by using DBMS: 
   1. it keeps data accurate and prevention of mistakes 
   2. it can manipulate who can see or change the data 	
   3. it allows many users use the data ate the same time

4. These are the difference between Primary Key, Foreign Key, and Candidate Key:
   Primary Key - a unique ID for each record 
   Foreign Key - a field that links to one table to another
   Candidate Key - a possible unique ID, one is the chosen main ID 

                                         PART B CASE SCENARIOS:
         Case 1 School Library System:

1. These are the 3 Entities:
   Books
   Students
   Transactions

2. These are the Attributes:
   Books: ISBN, Title, Author, Year Published, Category
   Students: Student ID, Name, Course, Year Level
   Transactions: Borrow ID, Date Borrowed, Date Returned, Student ID, ISBN

3. These are the Primary Keys:
   Books: ISBN
   Students: Student ID
   Transactions: Borrow ID

4. The Textual Entity-Relationship Diagram: 
   Books (ISBN) —< Transactions (Borrow ID) >— Students (Student ID)

       Case 2: Hospital Patient Records

Why is a database better than Excel for patient data?
    A database is better than Excel for patient data because it can store large amounts of 
    information without slowing down, allows many users to access and update data at the 
    same time without errors, keeps the data safe with backups, and helps prevent mistakes 
    like duplicates or missing records.

2. These are the possible relationships between entities (e.g., One-to-Many, Many-to-Many).
   One patient can have many appointments (One-to-Many).
   One doctor can have many appointments (One-to-Many).
   Patients and doctors are connected through appointments, so many patients can see many doctors (Many-to-Many).

3. These are my sample of table schema 3 tables: 
   1. Patients:
   PatientID (Primary Key)
   Name 
   Age
   Gender
   ContactNumber

   2. Doctors:
   DoctorID (Primary Key)
   Name
   Specialization

   3. Appointments:
   AppointmentID (Primary Key)
   Date
   Time
   PatientID (Foreign Key)
   DoctorID (Foreign Key)

       Case 3: Online Shopping Store

1. Identifications of Foreign Keys: 
   In the orders, the Customer ID points to a customer in the Customers list.
   Also, Product ID in the orders points to a product in the Products list.

2. This will happen if referential integrity is not maintained:
   If an order is made for a customer who doesn’t exist, or if a customer is 
   deleted but their orders stay, it can cause confusion and errors. 
   This makes the data inconsistent and hard to manage.

3. This is how the company can ensure data consistency:
   Use rules in the database to prevent adding orders for non-existent customers or products. 
   When deleting a customer or product, update or remove related orders automatically. 
   Regularly check the data for errors and only allow trusted people to make important changes.

    
        Part C: Reflection:

  On my opinion the hospital keeps patient records in a database. This helps doctors find important information quickly, 
  like allergies or medicines. If there was no database, it would be hard to keep track of everything, 
  and mistakes could happen. It shows how databases help keep things organized and safe in real life.
